# Herdr Mobile Relay Quick Start

Connect one Linux or macOS computer to your phone through a temporary Cloudflare
tunnel, or through a gateway that needs no Cloudflare account (see **Skip
Cloudflare**). You need Herdr 0.7.5 or newer, Git, and `curl`.

## 1. Install

```bash
herdr plugin install 0cv/herdr-mobile-relay
```

Choose **Temporary Cloudflare Tunnel** when the setup menu opens. If it does
not:

```bash
herdr plugin action invoke setup --plugin herdr-mobile-relay.events
```

Approve missing user-level tools if prompted. The plugin downloads the exact
verified relay bundle; it does not require Python, Node.js, a Go toolchain, or
`sudo`.

## 2. Pair the Phone

Both paths print the QR once they know which origin serves the phone app.

On the tunnel path, wait for the temporary tunnel, then choose:

- **This temporary relay** for a simple one-computer trial.
- **An existing installed Herdr app** to add this computer to an app you already
  use.

On the gateway path the QR follows registration, and the app origin has to be an
installed Herdr app — a gateway carries relay traffic only. It reuses a recorded
or `HERDR_PHONE_APP_URL` origin, and asks for one when neither exists.

Scan the QR or open the complete HTTPS setup link. Keep it private: it contains
the relay encryption key in the URL fragment. The fragment is not sent in the
HTTP request, and the app removes it after import.

Keep the Quick Start pane open. Ctrl-C stops the relay, and on the tunnel path
the next run creates a new hostname and setup link.

## 3. Try It

Run an agent in Herdr or tap **＋** in the phone app. You can inspect output,
send prompts, answer approvals and plan questions, upload images, and manage the
agent lifecycle.

## Skip Cloudflare

Choose **Community WebRTC Gateway** in the setup menu. It checks the project's
published gateways, saves the ordered list, then starts the relay and prints its
QR. No account, no domain, no `cloudflared`. The gateways are run by the
project: free, shared, best-effort.

A gateway carries relay traffic only, so the phone app lives elsewhere: point
`HERDR_PHONE_APP_URL` at an installed Herdr app, or host one with
`make web-deploy`.

A gateway cannot read your traffic — it copies frames that are already encrypted
between the phone and the relay — and right after connecting both sides try to
cut it out of the path with a direct WebRTC connection.

[docs/transports.md](docs/transports.md) explains every choice and its settings;
[docs/gateway-self-hosting.md](docs/gateway-self-hosting.md) covers running your
own gateway.

## Make It Permanent

Add a domain to Cloudflare, then run:

```bash
herdr plugin action invoke install-service --plugin herdr-mobile-relay.events
```

The wizard creates or resumes a dedicated tunnel, installs a background user
service, verifies the public endpoint, and prints the stable QR. Repeat it on
each computer with a different hostname and add every QR to the same phone app.

[docs/cloudflare-tunnel.md](docs/cloudflare-tunnel.md) has the rest: hostname
changes, the full action list, teardown, and uninstall.

## Troubleshooting

- **Port 8375 is busy:** stop the previous Quick Start or installed service.
- **Temporary URL fails:** rerun Quick Start for a fresh hostname.
- **Gateway registration times out:** check `HERDR_GATEWAY_URL` and outbound
  HTTPS access; `curl -s localhost:8375/healthz` reports `gateway.registered`.
- **App stays disconnected:** reopen the full link including `#setup=...`.
- **Need the stable QR again:** invoke `setup-link`.
- **Stable setup stops:** rerun the exact command it prints; setup is resumable.
