// Release guard, not a platform limit: catch accidental bootstrap growth.
// Push-only notification art loads inside the service worker, not the page.
// Raised from 108 KiB for the hybrid transport (gateway pairing, DataChannel
// framing, path manager): the release contract ships one `assets/app.js`, so
// the direct-upgrade code cannot be split out of the bootstrap payload.
// Raised from 112 KiB for connection-path visibility and reconnect-code
// handling in 0.17.0, after removing the dead CSS that padded the old budget.
// Raised from 113 KiB for the no-echo prompt route (masked secret input, its
// relay capability gate), the F1-F12 pad, and GFM tables in conversation
// history: all three land in the single bootstrap `assets/app.js`.
// Raised from 115 KiB for Resize Session row leasing and the px-derived
// terminal width caps (issue #11), which also land in the bootstrap payload.
// Raised from 116 KiB for the conversation-history bottom pin (issue #12): the
// observer that owns the pin, its scroll tracker and the stream box it watches
// measure +126 B gzip in `assets/app.js` and +2 B in `assets/app.css`, and the
// released 0.17.4 payload left only 107 B under the old ceiling.
// Raised from 117 KiB for the Conversation History prompt composer (issue #13):
// prompt dispatch safety, interaction locks and image attachment add 1,525 B
// gzip to the released 0.17.5 baseline, which had 1,208 B of headroom.
// Raised from 118 KiB for authoritative workspace topology and the complete
// workspace/worktree manager (issue #14): empty workspace cards, safe
// destructive confirmations, directory selection, and worktree create/open
// flows add one project-level control surface to the single application bundle.
// Raised from 123 KiB for the native-style workspace follow-up: shared
// long-press drag ordering, modal create/worktree flows, and nested linked
// worktrees add 2,750 B gzip to the 0.17.6 bundle.
// Raised from 126 KiB for the worktree tree presentation (issue #14 review):
// connector rails, informative-only provenance/path rows, and the flat-Git
// worktree gating add 482 B gzip to the 0.17.8 bundle, 19 B past the ceiling.
// The gzip figure is the measuring runtime's zlib, not a property of the
// bundle: the same bytes measure ~300 B larger under Bun than under Node, so
// compare numbers only across runs on the same runtime (the repo uses Bun).
// Raised from 127 KiB for compact conversation tool cards and pending-lease
// terminal recovery: payload formatting/clamping and bounded resize handling
// both ship in the single bootstrap bundle.
// Raised from 128 KiB for first-class shell panes: capability-gated shell
// creation, shell-aware controls, and raw terminal input share that bundle.
