# Changelog

Notable user-facing changes to Herdr Mobile Relay are documented here. The
project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.19.1] - 2026-08-29

### Fixed

- Conversation now shows only user prompts and the latest agent answer from each
  exchange. Intermediate agent messages and tool activity remain available in
  Full history, so the two tabs no longer render effectively the same transcript.

## [0.19.0] - 2026-08-29

### Added

- Transcript, session-title, and native skill discovery now resolve through
  profile-aware agent roots. Relay-side path lists cover Claude Code, Qoder,
  Codex, Pi, and Oh My Pi, while named Pi and Oh My Pi profiles under their
  default configuration roots are discovered automatically.
- Slash-command palettes follow the current native skill and extension sources
  for Pi, Oh My Pi, and standalone Kimi Code, including project scope, trust,
  configured directories, plugin overrides, and contained manifest paths.

### Fixed

- Conversation titles and history now resolve through the same contained
  transcript, so copied session IDs, stale Codex index rows, and project
  symlinks can no longer pair a title with a missing or different conversation.
- Explicit per-profile command opt-outs are preserved instead of falling
  through to native skill discovery.
- Oh My Pi tool-approval dialogs are classified as live approvals.
- Slash-command names and descriptions use a stacked mobile layout, so long
  skill names cannot overlap or squeeze their descriptions.

## [0.18.4] - 2026-08-28

### Added

- Catppuccin Latte is available as a light app theme with a matching light
  terminal pane. (#26)

### Fixed

- Installing a setup link to an iPhone Home Screen now carries its relay or
  gateway address and key into the isolated standalone app, so the installed
  app connects without entering the setup details again.
- Terminal and conversation-history views now fill the complete iPhone screen
  in standalone mode instead of leaving a blank strip beneath the terminal
  controls. (#25)

## [0.18.3] - 2026-08-25

### Fixed

- Pane-size lease renewals no longer run `stty` when the TTY already has the
  requested rows and columns. The phone renews its lease every ten seconds;
  reasserting an unchanged size still reached the TTY resize syscall, which
  could make an agent repaint and the streamed terminal reflow at that exact
  cadence even though its geometry had not changed. Renewals now extend only
  the lease TTL; real phone, desktop, and multi-client size changes still
  resize the pane.
- A failed app cutover no longer traps the phone in a rapid reload loop. The
  successful deployment announcement persists across page loads, but the old
  client kept its reload guard only in memory; if the old bundle survived the
  first navigation, every new instance connected, saw 0.18.2 already deployed,
  and immediately navigated again. Automatic reload attempts are now recorded
  per target in session storage and cleared only after that version actually
  loads. Cloudflare Pages' `/index.html` → `/` redirect is also normalized
  without leaving the cache-bust marker in the installed app URL.

## [0.18.2] - 2026-08-25

### Fixed

- Setup links preserve their complete target across wrapped terminal output and reject malformed values before QR or terminal rendering.

## [0.18.1] - 2026-08-24

### Fixed

- Phone-app deployment no longer fails on macOS with an error that blames the
  release bundle. The relay starts its deployment worker with `launchctl
  submit`, which runs it from the filesystem root, and Wrangler resolves its
  working files relative to whatever directory it is started in — so every
  deployment died creating `/.wrangler/cache`, then `/.wrangler/tmp`, on the
  read-only system volume. Wrangler reports those as missing directories, and
  the shortened diagnostic dropped the line naming them, so the update looked
  as though the staged release had disappeared even though the relay had
  already verified that bundle byte for byte. Deployment now runs from a
  directory the relay owns, which covers every path Wrangler derives from its
  working directory. This is separate from the asset cache skipped in 0.18.0:
  that option covers the Pages upload cache only.
- A failed phone-app deployment no longer leaves its job file behind. Only
  successful deployments removed theirs, so a relay retrying a deployment it
  could not complete accumulated one file per attempt — thousands on a relay
  left retrying. Nothing ever re-reads a job file, so the worker now discards
  it whichever way the deployment ends.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-08-24

### Fixed

- The relay no longer re-broadcasts a full `agents` snapshot on every
  reconcile poll while nothing has changed. An idle machine used to push a
  fresh copy of the whole inventory to every phone at the poll cadence —
  in a different random order each time, because the snapshot iterated a Go
  map — so idle phones re-processed an "update" every 15 seconds. Snapshots
  are now emitted in a stable pane order and a broadcast is skipped when
  nothing a client renders differs from the previous one; explicit
  `refresh_agents` requests are still answered immediately.
- Workspace broadcasts follow the same discipline: the topology snapshot is
  read under the ordering lock so the reconcile poll can never publish an
  older workspace list over a newer one from the event stream, and a
  byte-identical repeat is suppressed.
- A workspace or worktree command queued behind a running one no longer
  stalls the relay's whole inbound pipeline. Its ingress admission used to
  wait for the running Herdr command to finish — up to its 60-second
  deadline — during which prompts and approvals from every phone sat
  undispatched. (#14)
- A `#launch=` deep link now hands the form to its requested computer even
  when another relay connects first; previously the faster sibling kept the
  selection and the link's workspace and directory were silently dropped.
  A relay picked by hand is left alone. (#14)
- Opening another pane's conversation history via a direct link remounts the
  view, so the reply draft, transcript, and scroll pin can no longer carry
  over from the previously shown agent. (#13)
- The Worktrees dialog ignores a slow listing that resolves after the dialog
  moved on to another workspace; its Open buttons could otherwise submit one
  repository's paths under another repository's workspace. (#14)
- Creating a workspace or worktree whose confirmation was lost in transit no
  longer invites a blind retry that could apply the mutation twice: the
  dialog steers to the current list first, matching how prompts already
  handle an ambiguous outcome. (#13, #14)

## [0.17.11] - 2026-08-24

### Changed

- Tab names on home-screen workspace cards sit directly above their agent
  cards instead of floating in a tall header reserved for the removed reorder
  buttons.
- The header workspace icons are drawn taller, matching the height of the
  neighboring symbols instead of looking vertically compressed.

## [0.17.10] - 2026-08-24

### Changed

- The home screen defaults to the **Mixed** workspace layout: one card per
  workspace with a dot for its most notable session. **By State** remains
  available under Settings → Home Workspaces, and a previously saved choice is
  kept either way. (#14)

## [0.17.9] - 2026-08-24

### Changed

- Linked worktrees now render as a tree with connector rails under their
  repository workspace on the home screen and the Workspaces page, matching
  Herdr's own parent/child presentation. Rows no longer repeat what their
  context already says: the "Linked worktree" label is gone from nested cards,
  "Repository · name" appears only when the repository differs from the card
  title, and a checkout path shows only when it differs from the worktree's
  label. An orphaned worktree whose repository workspace is closed says
  "Worktree of name" instead. (#14)
- The **Worktrees** dialog is offered on repository workspaces only. Git
  worktrees are flat, so Herdr cannot create a worktree from inside a linked
  worktree; the button no longer appears on those cards. (#14)

## [0.17.8] - 2026-08-23

### Fixed

- Workspace and worktree commands no longer stall the relay's inbound command
  lane while Herdr executes them; a slow worktree creation used to block every
  client's prompts and reads until it finished. (#14)
- Realtime topology events survive older compatible Herdr versions again: the
  event subscription no longer requests `workspace.reordered` when the
  connected Herdr predates `workspace.move_block`, which previously failed the
  whole subscription and silently degraded updates to polling. (#14)
- Uncertain outcomes are reported honestly end to end: a workspace or tab move
  whose request was written but never answered, and a worktree mutation whose
  result envelope cannot be read, now surface as "may have applied" instead of
  inviting a retry; the app treats a disconnect or confirmation timeout after a
  sent prompt the same way, so a restored draft can no longer double-send.
  (#13, #14)
- The Conversation History draft persists per agent across view switches and
  clears with the sent prompt, matching the terminal composer. (#13)
- Workspace manager robustness: a directory listing that resolves after
  switching computers can no longer leak the previous computer's path into
  Create Workspace; rename state resets when the selected computer changes; an
  optimistic drag order is dropped once the authoritative workspace set
  changes; a worktree dialog dismissed mid-request stays closed; Remove
  Worktree is disabled without worktree support and capability errors name the
  actual missing feature; the Workspaces button no longer stacks duplicate
  history entries; empty linked worktrees whose repository workspace is closed
  stay visible; and workspace tab and pane counts follow desktop tab changes
  immediately instead of waiting for the next poll. (#14)

## [0.17.7] - 2026-08-23

### Changed

- Match native Herdr workspace management more closely: **Create Workspace**
  and **Worktrees** now open focused dialogs instead of expanding the page;
  workspace ordering uses the same hold-and-drag interaction as home-page tab
  ordering, with Alt+arrow keys on the reorder handle; and linked worktrees are
  nested below their repository workspace instead of appearing as unrelated
  top-level cards. Reordering a repository moves its linked-worktree block
  atomically when the connected Herdr exposes `workspace.move_block`; older
  compatible Herdr versions can still move standalone workspaces and are asked
  to update before moving a linked group. A new workspace keeps Herdr's initial
  tab, and **Start Agent** adds the agent as the following tab. (#14)

## [0.17.6] - 2026-08-23

### Added

- Reply from searchable Conversation History with an ordinary multiline prompt
  or image attachment, and switch back to the same agent's terminal from the
  history header. The composer locks for approvals, structured questions, and
  other terminal-only interactions; uncertain dispatches stay cleared so a
  retry cannot duplicate a prompt that may already have arrived. Attachment
  status is cleared with the sent draft instead of leaking into the next reply.
  (#13)
- Manage Herdr workspaces and Git worktrees from the phone without exposing
  ordinary shell panes as agent terminals or stealing desktop focus. The home
  screen now keeps authoritative workspace labels, ordering, worktree
  provenance, and shell-only or empty workspaces instead of reconstructing
  workspace cards solely from active agents. The new Workspaces view can create,
  rename, reorder, and close workspaces; start an agent in a selected workspace;
  and list, create, open, close, or remove Herdr-managed worktrees. Worktree
  removal keeps the branch, refuses dirty checkouts by default, and offers force
  removal only through a second destructive confirmation. Every mutation is
  protocol-gated and recorded in the private remote-write audit log. (#14)

## [0.17.5] - 2026-08-22

### Fixed

- Conversation History opens on the newest turn again instead of the first turn
  of the session. The view did try to pin to the end on load, but the scroll ran
  while the list was still behind the loading placeholder — there was no
  scroller to move yet — and a single flush could not see the final height of
  rendered markdown anyway: wrapped prose, tables and code blocks settle a
  layout pass later, which is why transcripts heavy on them were the worst
  (measured 12,343 px short of the end on a 60-turn transcript in Safari, 12,210
  px in Chromium). A resize observer now owns the pin: it watches the turns and
  the viewport around them, so mount, late layout, new turns, rotation and the
  on-screen keyboard all re-apply it. Scrolling up to read releases the pin and
  later turns no longer yank the view; returning to the end restores it.
  Unrelated to the terminal transcript's `content-visibility` defect fixed in
  0.17.2 — this component never used that property. (#12)

## [0.17.4] - 2026-08-21

### Fixed

- Phone-app deployment now uses Wrangler 4.125.0 and skips its differential
  Pages asset cache. Wrangler 4.114.0 could fail with only `exit status 1`
  when an older deployment's cache was stale, leaving the relay updated but
  the separately hosted phone app on the old bundle. Deployment errors now
  strip terminal color codes and preserve the tail containing the actual
  Cloudflare cause instead of truncating it behind the command prefix.

## [0.17.3] - 2026-08-21

### Changed

- Streaming resumes immediately when you come back to the app. The app now
  sends a small proof-of-life ping to every connected relay every two minutes,
  including while it is in the background, so the gateway's five-minute idle
  reaper no longer takes a live connection from a phone that is merely hidden:
  coming back finds the connection already up instead of paying a full re-dial
  (TLS, WebSocket, relay hello, encrypted handshake). Where the platform
  suspends the page instead — iOS backgrounds a tab within seconds — the
  connection cannot survive, and the app now recognises that from the silence
  and reconnects on the spot rather than spending two seconds probing a dead
  path first. A connection that answered recently is still kept and probed
  exactly as before, so switching apps never churns a healthy session. A ping
  that goes unanswered while the app is hidden closes the connection without
  redialing in the background, and after an hour hidden the pings stop
  altogether so a phone in a pocket is not kept awake; both cases reconnect
  the moment the app is opened. Terminal size leases are unaffected.
- Device verification no longer costs a reconnect. Hiding the app used to drop
  every relay connection, so verification users paid a full re-dial after each
  glance away and could never benefit from the warm connection above. Locking
  now gates the interface only: the encrypted session stays open, and a
  successful verification picks it up instead of dialing again. This gives up
  nothing — the relay key lives in the browser's local storage and the unlock
  reconnected with it either way, so dropping the connection denied an attacker
  nothing it does not already have. The unlock screen now covers the page
  instead of dimming it: the session behind it is live, so a see-through scrim
  would have left agent names and status changes readable — and stale ones
  readable already. The open terminal also stops streaming and stops holding
  the computer's pane at the phone's width until verification succeeds.

## [0.17.2] - 2026-08-21

### Added

- **Lease Terminal Height** (Settings → Terminal, off by default). Resize
  Session can now lease the phone's measured height alongside its width when
  the relay advertises `pane_size_lease_rows`, so full-screen agents redraw at
  the phone's row count instead of stranding their response above dozens of
  blank desktop-height rows. It ships off by default because changing the
  shared pane's height can strand a stale copy of an inline agent's status bar
  in the computer's scrollback: the terminal reflows its primary buffer before
  the agent can repaint, and scrollback cannot be erased afterwards. Turn it on
  if you mostly drive full-screen TUIs from the phone. While the height is
  leased, the on-screen keyboard never shrinks it. Width leasing, and relays
  without row support, are unchanged. (#11)

### Fixed

- Terminal lines no longer wrap short of the leased width on Safari. Width
  caps were emitted in `ch` units while columns were measured from a pixel
  probe, and Safari resolves `ch` to the 0.5em spec fallback when the bundled
  symbols font — which has no digit glyphs — is the first available font, so
  every cap came out ~19% narrow: text wrapped early, Compact grew a right
  gap, and virtual row heights were mis-estimated. Every cap, including the
  text runs and horizontal rules inside TUI boxes and status bars, now
  multiplies the same probed px cell. (#11)
- Opening a session on Safari now shows the transcript's end immediately and
  scrolling no longer flickers: `content-visibility: auto` made Safari size
  offscreen mounted rows at one line regardless of wrapping (the rows are
  already virtualized by the app, so the property only corrupted
  scrollHeight), and a browser clamp after row-height corrections was misread
  as the user scrolling toward history, permanently dropping the
  stick-to-bottom pin. (#11)
- Switching away from the app on desktop Safari no longer resizes the shared
  pane. Safari reports an occluded window as hidden, so the deliberate
  stop-renewing-while-hidden policy — designed for a sleeping phone — lapsed
  the pane-size lease on every app switch, and each restore/re-lease SIGWINCH
  pair could strand a stale status bar. A hidden page now keeps renewing for
  five minutes, and the lease TTL rises from 30 to 120 seconds because Safari
  degrades a hidden tab's timers to a measured 60–65 second cadence within two
  minutes — renewals kept arriving, but the old TTL expired between them. A
  frozen or vanished client gives the pane back within about two minutes; a
  disconnecting one is still released immediately.
- Streaming resumes seconds after the phone wakes instead of dozens of seconds
  in gateway mode. A reconnect dial started before the radio was back got
  blackholed, and the wake/online revalidation skipped anything already
  "connecting" — so the phone sat out the full handshake timeout plus
  reconnect backoff. Revalidation now replaces a connect attempt older than
  five seconds, so the first event after the network returns redials at once.
- The row lease no longer shrinks while the on-screen keyboard is open:
  typing toggled two height resizes per keyboard cycle, and each full-height
  redraw could strand a stale copy of an agent's status bar in the scrollback.

### Changed

- Frontend development and CI run on Bun 1.4 instead of Node.js and npm:
  Playwright, Vitest, ESLint, svelte-check, and the build scripts all run
  under Bun, with `bun.lock` replacing `package-lock.json`. CI installs the
  browsers natively instead of pulling Playwright's container image; the
  container path remains for Fedora. Publishing the hosted web app still uses
  `npx wrangler` and Node. This changes no shipped bytes — the built bundle is
  byte-identical, brotli included.

## [0.17.1] - 2026-08-20

### Fixed

- Terminal Find now opens from the compact header, keeps Copy as a compact
  two-sheet action, and uses larger SVG controls for previous, next, and close.
  The empty bar no longer spends space on the unhelpful “Type to find” label;
  match counts appear once a query is entered.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-08-20

### Added

- Hybrid transport: set `HERDR_GATEWAY_URL` and the relay registers with a
  blind WSS gateway instead of a Cloudflare tunnel, so Quick Start no longer
  installs, launches, or requires `cloudflared` and needs no Cloudflare
  account. The gateway holds no secrets — the relay registers under an
  HKDF-derived id, the relay itself verifies the phone's challenge response,
  and the gateway only copies already-encrypted frames. It is a single static
  binary you can self-host (`make gateway`,
  [docs/gateway-self-hosting.md](docs/gateway-self-hosting.md)).
- Direct WebRTC upgrade: after connecting, phone and computer negotiate a
  reliable ordered DataChannel inside the encrypted channel and move traffic
  off the gateway, falling back to it automatically when the direct path is
  unavailable or breaks. `HERDR_WEBRTC_UDP_PORT`,
  `HERDR_REACHABILITY_PORT_MAPPING`, and `HERDR_TRANSPORT_FORCE_RELAY` tune
  and, for testing, disable it. This is the first path that opens a UDP socket
  on the computer; ICE credentials travel only inside the encrypted channel and
  DTLS certificates are pinned by SDP fingerprint. See the README security
  section.
- `GET /healthz` reports gateway registration state, and releases declare both
  `herdr-e2ee-v1` and `herdr-hybrid-v1` so existing phones keep working across
  the upgrade in either order. Cloudflare tunnels remain fully supported.
- Gateway deployment from the setup menu: **Deploy or Upgrade Your Own WebRTC
  Gateway → Deploy one on my own server over SSH** asks for the public hostname
  and the server's SSH address, then writes a compose bundle, copies it over one
  authenticated SSH connection, optionally installs Docker, builds and starts the
  gateway there, and records the `wss://` URL only after the public `/healthz`
  answers. The bundle carries the gateway source it builds, so the server needs
  nothing but Docker — no Go toolchain, no registry, and nothing fetched from
  GitHub — and the relay key never leaves the computer.
- Gateway address discovery on UDP 3478 (`HERDR_GATEWAY_STUN_ADDR`, empty
  disables it): the gateway reflects the address it already sees a peer coming
  from, so the phone and the relay both gather reflexive ICE candidates and the
  direct WebRTC path now forms off the LAN without router configuration — a
  phone on a cellular network reaches a home computer directly instead of
  falling back to the relayed path. No third-party service is involved, only the
  port is advertised (each peer combines it with the gateway host it already
  dialed), and self-hosted gateways need inbound UDP 3478 open; UPnP/NAT-PMP
  port mapping still helps but is no longer required.
- A community gateway is now published and offered as the second connection
  choice, after the Cloudflare tunnel: free, shared, best-effort, with no
  account, no domain, and nothing to configure. `HERDR_COMMUNITY_GATEWAY_URL`
  overrides it, and an explicitly empty value means a build runs none.
- Whole-gateway ceilings for shared instances: `HERDR_GATEWAY_MAX_RELAYS`
  (default 1024) and `HERDR_GATEWAY_MAX_CLIENTS` (default 512) refuse new
  registrations and connections with `at_capacity`, bounding memory that the
  per-relay and per-IP limits could not. Address discovery also gains a global
  ceiling. There is deliberately no per-IP concurrency cap, because carrier NAT
  shares one address across thousands of unrelated phones.
- Per-session ICE candidate types and the nominated pair are reported in the
  relay's `/healthz` as `webrtc_sessions`, which answers whether a session is
  direct and over which candidate type. Types only: no address ever appears.
- Direct-path telemetry in the relay's `/healthz`: `sessions_direct_total` and
  `sessions_relayed_total` count how often the direct path actually formed
  since the relay started. Local only, counts only, nothing leaves the machine.
- Ordered gateway lists: `HERDR_GATEWAY_URL` accepts several comma-separated
  gateways, the QR carries the whole list, and both relay and phone move to the
  next one when a gateway is unreachable. Pairing links produced now always
  carry the list, so adding a second gateway later needs no re-scan.
- Phone Settings names the path each relay is on: the gateway carrying it, the
  direct peer-to-peer session and the gateway that signalled it, or the relay
  URL. A configured candidate list no longer hides which entry answered.
- Documentation restructured: the README is now a short overview that gets a new
  user to a paired phone, with the detail split into `docs/mobile-app.md`,
  `docs/transports.md`, `docs/cloudflare-tunnel.md`, `docs/updates.md`,
  `docs/security.md`, and `docs/development.md`.
- A terminal asking for a hidden value — `sudo`, an SSH passphrase, `gpg` — is
  named on the phone and answered through a masked field that is typed straight
  into the pane as keystrokes. The value is never written to this phone's draft
  storage, never inserted as bracketed-paste text, and never kept in the
  activity journal or the write audit.
- The terminal key pad gained an `F keys` row covering F1–F12, and labels the
  modifiers by symbol — `⇧`, `^`, `⇥` — so the whole pad fits one row.
- Conversation history renders Markdown tables as tables, scrolling sideways on
  a narrow phone instead of collapsing into one paragraph.

### Changed

- Gateway setup links carry only the complete ordered `gateways` list, and phone
  Settings shows every candidate that can reach each relay.
- Both self-hosted gateway paths end with an editable subscription list; the
  default keeps the operator gateway first and community gateways as cold
  fallbacks.
- Phone Settings and the setup menu show the active gateway version, the latest
  version available from the verified plugin release, and the computer-side
  install or redeploy path for an outdated self-hosted gateway.
- Faster resume: returning to the app clears stale reconnect backoff and probes
  the existing application path for 2 seconds before replacing it. A healthy
  direct session now resumes without gateway traffic; only a stale session
  opens a fresh gateway-assisted connection.
- A visible phone now probes the application connection when Chromium reports a
  Wi-Fi/cellular network change. A healthy path remains open; a half-open path
  gets 2 s to answer before reconnecting.
- With multiple `HERDR_GATEWAY_URL` entries, the relay now probes all gateway
  health endpoints concurrently at startup, then registers with the first
  healthy entry in configured order: a list you configure is a priority list,
  not a preference, so a gateway you own is not displaced by a faster one
  further down. After a failure it excludes that entry and takes the next
  healthy one. `HERDR_GATEWAY_SELECTION=latency` asks for the lowest-latency
  healthy entry instead, with configured order breaking ties within 20 ms; the
  setup chooser writes it for the community list, whose gateways are
  interchangeable, and `ordered` is the default everywhere else. The selected
  gateway is advertised first and saved by connected phones without
  interrupting their current session. The setup chooser accepts the managed
  list, validates every entry, and saves it when at least one gateway is
  healthy.
- Self-hosted gateway builds publish their release, revision, and wire protocol
  through `/healthz` and the gateway hello. The setup menu compares a remembered
  deployment with the installed plugin and names action 3 when it needs an
  upgrade; rerunning that action reuses the host, SSH address, and remote
  directory, then rebuilds and recreates the gateway and proxy on the current
  Compose network.
- A relay reached over its existing Cloudflare URL now advertises its gateway,
  and the app records it and prefers the hybrid path on the next connection —
  no QR re-scan. The original URL is kept and is used automatically if the
  gateway turns out to be unreachable from that phone.
- Gateway-relayed terminal watches now honor the configured 100, 250, 500, or
  1,000 ms refresh rate while still capping scrollback at 1,000 lines.
  Acknowledged deltas keep unchanged frames off the metered path.
- A gateway no longer displaces a relay registration that is still alive: the
  incumbent link is pinged first and keeps its id if it answers, so anyone who
  learns a relay id cannot evict the real computer in a loop. A crashed or
  disconnected relay still reclaims its id immediately.
- A phone told the shared gateway is full now says so and offers to retry or
  switch connection method, instead of reporting a generic failure.
- Address discovery re-probes a learned NAT mapping every 10 s instead of every
  30 minutes, so a mapping that the router drops while the session is idle is
  noticed and republished rather than advertised dead until the next self-test.
  Newly discovered mappings are also trickled into sessions already negotiating,
  including port-preserving NATs, rather than waiting for an attempt to time out
  and retry.
- The gateway selection rule is administered from the setup menu instead of
  only `HERDR_GATEWAY_SELECTION`. Setup prints each candidate's measured round
  trip, asks how to read a multi-entry list — defaulting to first-listed for a
  list built around your own gateway and closest for the community pool — and
  the menu status line names the rule that picked the active gateway. Revisiting
  the own-gateway action keeps the saved list, so changing only the rule no
  longer means retyping addresses.
- Relay Git revisions display as short hashes on the phone, which fit a narrow
  row instead of being truncated mid-hash; the full revision stays in the
  row's tooltip.

### Fixed

- A prompt draft too large to persist no longer resurrects an older, shorter one
  after a pane switch: the superseded stored copy is deleted, and the live text
  is kept in memory so it survives switching panes, though not closing the app.
- The terminal renders on browsers without `Intl.Segmenter` instead of leaving
  the whole app blank; grapheme measurement falls back to code points.
- A pane read asked for as plain text now stays on the visible grid. Herdr
  reaches rows above the viewport by driving the agent's own scroll interface,
  which visibly scrolls the desktop pane and costs seconds per read, so text
  reads no longer request recent scrollback.
- Jump to agent shows every agent again. Once the result list reached its
  height limit each workspace group was squeezed instead of the list scrolling,
  so agent rows were cut in half and there was no way to scroll to them.
- A divider drawn from `─` alone is one continuous line again. Wider than the
  phone, it used to fall through to ordinary text and wrap, leaving a full-width
  stroke with a short offcut hanging underneath; the same happened to the two
  halves a pane produces when it reflows a rule it cannot fit.
- Clearing or stopping an agent asks on its own: the confirmation replaces the
  menu with the question, one confirm button, and Cancel, instead of leaving
  Rename and the other destructive action a tap away. Cancel returns to the menu.
- The Tab and Shift keys are drawn rather than typed. Their characters resolve
  to a different font on each platform, which left them sitting visibly off the
  line the lettered keys share — low on Android, high on the desktop.
- Leaving a terminal and returning to it no longer stalls the stream for a
  second or two. The relay restored the pane's own width the moment the terminal
  closed and narrowed it again on the way back, and the agent re-rendered on both
  resizes. A released width now lapses after ten seconds instead, so a return
  within that window reuses the width the pane already has.
- A sleeping phone gives the desktop its terminal width back. The app renewed
  its Resize Session lease every ten seconds even while hidden — an open
  DataChannel keeps the page running in the background — so the pane stayed at
  phone width all night. A hidden app now stops renewing, the lease lapses, and
  the relay restores the desktop width within half a minute; refocusing leases
  the phone width again at once.
- Returning to an open terminal after the connection died no longer takes
  dozens of seconds to stream again. The refocus read and watch were sent while
  the transport was still down and lost silently, leaving the terminal to the
  fifteen-second resync interval. A reconnect now re-reads every watched pane
  itself, so the stream resumes within a round trip of the relay coming back.
- A phone no longer stays disconnected until a manual reload after its relay
  restarts. The gateway answers `unknown_relay` while a relay's registration
  lapses during an update, and the app treated that as a permanently fatal
  configuration and stopped reconnecting. That code now keeps the normal
  reconnect cadence, and every other fatal failure retries once a minute
  instead of never.
- The update status no longer flickers to "checking" once a second while the
  app waits for a deployed bundle to reach its origin. The wait polls
  silently, and a relay's stale record of an already-loaded deployment can
  start it at most once per app session instead of on every store update.
- Stable tunnel teardown can recover its identity again after older no-op
  teardowns cleared the state: the wizard records the tunnel UUID in its
  `cloudflared` config, so recovery now resolves that id to its Cloudflare name
  before the Herdr namespace guard judges it. It still refuses a foreign tunnel,
  and an unresolvable id now says how to authorize the lookup.
- An empty `HERDR_GATEWAY_STUN_ADDR` in a generated gateway bundle really
  disables address discovery; compose folded the empty value back into `:3478`.
- Relay update checks ignore prereleases even when GitHub's API is rate-limited:
  the fallback now resolves the latest stable tag through the `releases/latest`
  redirect instead of the release feed, which cannot mark one.
- Stable Tunnel setup no longer silently adopts a surviving custom
  `cloudflared` config after teardown. Reuse now requires explicit confirmation
  and reports the retained tunnel, hostname, and public DNS status. Stable
  teardown treats the validated Herdr state as the resource identity,
  not the historical `created_by_wizard` flags: one explicit confirmation
  removes the recorded tunnel, config, credentials, service, and local config
  pointer so the next install creates a clean relay.
  If an older no-op teardown already discarded that state, teardown reconstructs
  it from the retained Herdr config only after its namespace, loopback origin,
  hostname, and credential UUID validate.
- Stable Tunnel now preloads the domain authorized by the current
  `cloudflared` login and offers a new Cloudflare sign-in to select another
  account zone. It refuses an out-of-zone hostname before tunnel creation and
  verifies the exact CNAME named by `cloudflared`, since the CLI can exit zero
  after appending its old zone. Existing failed attempts identify the stray DNS
  record, resume after it is deleted, and reuse the tunnel under the correctly
  authorized domain.
- Stable Tunnel setup keeps multi-computer pairing on one installed app. A new
  computer probes `https://herdr.<authorized-zone>` for an existing Herdr app
  before falling back to its relay hostname, while the relay WebSocket remains
  inside the setup fragment. A configured deployment origin is authoritative:
  the setup menu reloads it after configuration and a connected relay-hosted
  app can no longer overwrite it in the background. The QR menu is now named
  **Choose Phone App and Show QR**, distinguishing origin selection from
  assigning a computer as the app deployment owner.
  When a current origin exists, submenu option 1 now explicitly keeps it;
  switching to the relay or another app requires options 2 or 3.
- The setup menu now exposes Temporary Cloudflare, Stable Cloudflare,
  Community WebRTC, and Own WebRTC as complete top-level actions instead of a
  connection submenu followed by Quick Start. Gateway choices immediately
  start or restart the relay and print its QR. Quick Start detects an installed
  background service and restarts it instead of failing on its occupied port,
  and menu actions enter the current plugin directory so an in-place plugin
  update cannot leave them in a deleted working directory. Switching from a
  gateway to Cloudflare also clears the menu's inherited gateway variables
  before generating the QR, preventing a Cloudflare relay from being paired
  through a gateway where it is no longer registered.
- A relay now probes the active gateway's public `/healthz` route every 15
  seconds while its registration is connected. Two consecutive failures rotate
  to the next candidate, covering the split failure where an established relay
  WebSocket survives but Caddy cannot route new phone connections. A phone also
  abandons a silent gateway handshake after 10 seconds so it can try the next
  advertised candidate.
- Rapid terminal updates no longer lose the pinned-to-latest scroll state while
  virtualized rows are being replaced, so an active stream stays at its newest
  message unless the user deliberately scrolls into history.

## [0.16.4] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed

- Creating an agent from the phone no longer fails on computers with a slow
  interactive shell. Herdr refuses `agent.start` with `agent_pane_busy` while
  the freshly created pane is still running shell startup, and it answers
  before its own `--timeout` window opens, so the relay now retries the
  refusal with a growing backoff until the request's budget runs out and hands
  Herdr the remaining budget instead of a fixed timeout.
- A failed agent start keeps the workspace Herdr created. The empty pane is
  reported with the failure and published to the phone, so a retry starts into
  it instead of the user losing the workspace and receiving only an error.
- `agent_pane_busy` is reported as a safe retry. It proves Herdr refused the
  command before anything ran, so the phone no longer advises reviewing an
  agent that was never created.

## [0.16.3] - 2026-08-17

### Fixed

- Opening an unchanged terminal no longer loops between a metadata-only pane
  update and a full resynchronization, which retransmitted the complete
  terminal history continuously and made idle data use scale with scrollback.

## [0.16.2] - 2026-08-16

### Changed

- Activity completion entries now capture and backfill the latest full
  conversation response for retained sessions, while generic working
  transitions remain available to the 24-hour summary but stay out of the
  activity list.

## [0.16.1] - 2026-08-16

### Fixed

- Reopening a previously viewed pane no longer leaves **Resize Session** stuck
  on “Resizing terminal…” when the terminal content stops changing before the
  resize settle window closes.
- Waking a sleeping phone or reopening a pane now keeps the cached terminal
  painted while the relay checks for a newer frame, then preserves the user's
  scroll anchor while a changed pane is redrawn.
- The terminal now reaches and snaps to its exact bottom without rubber-band
  overscroll, removing the persistent gap and flicker below the final row.
- Idle input prompts for Claude, Codex, OMP, Pi, OpenCode, Qoder, and Kimi are
  recognized after provider rate-limit failures, so the terminal returns to
  the chat composer instead of remaining in **Needs inspection** with text
  input disabled.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-08-16

### Changed

- Terminal history now renders Herdr's own pane window exactly as served.
  Herdr reflows its entire window (up to the newest 1,000 rows) to the current
  pty width on every read, so while a phone holds the Resize Session lease the
  whole visible history is already phone-shaped — no client-side stitching,
  no text matching across reads, and no rows spliced or silently dropped. The
  merge machinery that reconstructed history on the phone is deleted.
- Terminal History options are now 100, 500, or 1,000 lines (default 1,000),
  matching the most Herdr serves per pane read. The 5,000 and 10,000 options
  preserved rows client-side across width changes, which cannot be done
  faithfully: Herdr re-wraps its scrollback whenever the width changes, so
  retained rows from an earlier width never align with later reads. Saved
  larger preferences fall back to 1,000.

### Fixed

- Collapse desktop-width table borders (`┌──┬──┐`, `├──┼──┤`) to thin rules
  when history renders narrower than the width that produced them, instead of
  wrapping them into stacked ruler fragments. Cell text still re-wraps; a row
  of empty cells stays content.

## [0.15.11] - 2026-08-15

### Added

- Separate **Done** home-screen section for workspaces with finished sessions,
  between the input queue and Working.
- **Home Workspaces** setting: **By State** (default) keeps Done, Working, and
  Idle workspace sections; **Mixed** shows each workspace once with a dot for
  its most notable session — done, then working, then idle — and no section
  heading, since the per-card dots already carry that information. Agents
  needing input stay on top in both layouts.

### Fixed

- Retry a browser journey once on GitHub's CI runners if WebKit crashes
  mid-suite, so a transient runner-level crash unrelated to any test's
  assertions no longer blocks a release. Local runs are unaffected and stay
  at zero retries.

## [0.15.8] - 2026-08-15

### Fixed

- Make the deployed-app reload journey wait for the reloaded document instead
  of a URL that already matches before the navigation commits, so WebKit
  release validation no longer fails intermittently.

## [0.15.7] - 2026-08-15

### Fixed

- Stop losing terminal rows in **Resize Session** when output streams faster
  than the refresh interval: resized reads now return the recent scrollback
  window instead of only the live screen, and rows are committed to history
  once they scroll out of the viewport.
- Keep the history above the live viewport intact when opening a resized
  terminal, instead of cutting a screenful of pre-resize lines that the
  phone-width screen does not cover.
- Keep agent status bars, input boxes, and duplicated redraws out of resized
  terminal history: display reads now return physical rows, the pre-resize
  screen is cut from the baseline by exact row count, and the redrawn
  transcript block an agent pushes into scrollback on a width change is
  skipped instead of committed.
- Close the timing hole that let a late resize re-render reach history: the
  relay now marks pane frames read within three seconds of an actual leased
  width change, and the app skips committing rows from marked frames instead
  of relying on a one-shot skip that the agent's redraw could outlive.
- Document that Herdr serves at most about 1,000 rows per pane read: the
  5,000 and 10,000 Terminal History limits preserve rows beyond that while
  the terminal stays open and output streams, not when a pane is opened.
- Honour scrolling up while output is streaming: content growth no longer
  re-pins the terminal to the bottom, only a viewport or controls height
  change does. Reaching the bottom re-engages the pinned mode.
- Keep the reading position fixed while new output arrives: when the loaded
  window drops its oldest rows, the scroll anchor follows the same row instead
  of its stale index.

## [0.15.6] - 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- Preserve the requested terminal history through **Resize Session** while
  replacing only the stale desktop viewport with the clean phone-width screen.

## [0.15.5] - 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- Show the clean current pane after resizing a loaded agent instead of mixing
  terminal redraws captured at incompatible widths.

## [0.15.4] - 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- Restore iOS push notifications by using a routable HTTPS VAPID contact
  subject accepted by Apple's push service.

## [0.15.3] - 2026-08-13

### Changed

- Keep working agents visible in a workspace-grouped home-screen section and
  rename the remaining home-screen group to **Idle**.
- Reorder Herdr tabs from the phone by pressing and holding an agent card,
  then dragging: tabs slide around the lifted card as it follows the finger,
  and the new arrangement stays put while Herdr confirms. A plain tap still
  opens the agent, and Alt+arrow keys offer the same control. Desktop tab
  moves mirror back to the mobile order, which follows Herdr's visual
  positions instead of stable tab numbers.
- Make home-screen text unselectable so a long press starts a tab drag
  instead of the platform text-selection and search sheets.

## [0.15.2] - 2026-08-13

### Fixed

- Preserve Codex free-text answers by opening its notes editor before typing and
  pacing terminal input so **Enter** cannot overtake the pasted text.
- Detect Codex follow-up questions immediately, including partially drawn
  question frames and the current separate `esc to interrupt` footer.
- Switch an active chat to structured question controls as soon as a question
  frame arrives, and restore the terminal position when the question clears.
- Refresh structured question controls even when the terminal bytes have stopped
  changing, so an open plan no longer requires leaving and reopening the agent.

## [0.15.1] - 2026-08-13

### Fixed

- Keep terminal output pinned to its latest row when the mobile viewport or
  terminal controls change height, including when a scroll event arrives before
  resize observation.
- Submit free-text input and **Enter** as one ordered action in unclassified
  blocked panes.
- Render OMP and Pi **Ask** dialogs, including final answer reviews, with the
  same structured mobile controls as other supported agents; keep final
  submissions safe across relay state updates.
- Keep structured question controls mounted while an answer advances to the next
  question, including across terminal redraws and pane-refresh acknowledgements.
- Classify the OMP plan-review action menu as a structured approval so the
  phone offers its actions as buttons instead of the raw terminal.
- Parse OMP **Ask** questions whose frame is partially scrolled on narrow
  panes: a hidden custom-answer row no longer forces the raw terminal, wrapped
  question tabs still yield the right progress, and the inner scrollbar column
  no longer leaks into option labels.
- Keep the confirmed option selected when revisiting a Claude question whose
  free-text row still holds an earlier typed note; the stale note no longer
  re-selects **Other** or blocks resubmission.
- Load the existing OMP custom-answer note when revisiting a question, and
  replace the note instead of appending when a new answer is typed.
- Anchor the jump-to-latest button to the terminal output area so it no longer
  overlaps the composer send button.
- Use the full window width for the terminal and question layout on large
  screens instead of centering it with side margins.
- Number each answered question in the final review summary, render it on its
  own line with the question in bold, keep wrapped Claude review prompts
  complete, and show the actual typed free-text answer in the review instead
  of a placeholder once the relay has seen it (submitted from the phone or
  observed on a revisited question).
- Constrain the terminal to the window on wide agent-rail layouts so its
  history scrolls again instead of growing past the screen.
- Enlarge the header and agent-rail icons for easier tapping on tablets.
- Use a single comfortable column for home cards and workspaces on wide
  screens instead of a cramped two-column grid.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- Add workspace-first home cards, global agent search through the phone's
  magnifying-glass button, and a workspace agent rail on wider displays.
- Add read-only, symlink-confined workspace file, image, Git status, and unified
  diff inspection with bounded output, hardened Git execution, theme-aware diff
  colors, and per-diff pinch/button zoom.
- Add a focused user/final-answer conversation view plus full history with safe
  structured Markdown, per-message Markdown copy, and collapsible tool calls
  and results.
- Add isolated HTTP(S) links and conservative key-hint actions to terminal
  output.
- Add a retained 24-hour activity summary with observed working time,
  attention, completion, action, relay, and per-agent totals.
- Add private rotating JSONL attempt/result attribution for remote agent writes
  without storing prompt, response, or upload content.

### Changed

- Raise the guarded initial page payload ceiling from 96 KiB to 104 KiB for the
  expanded navigation and inspection UI, while moving push-only notification
  artwork out of the page bootstrap.

### Fixed

- Keep opened workspace cards expanded across agent navigation.
- Prevent non-agent pane metadata from briefly appearing as empty agent tabs.
- Let the mobile workspace sidebar collapse by swipe or button, and vertically
  center the Git branch label.
- Avoid repeating tab labels inside workspace agent tiles, and show relative
  activity ages only after the relay observes actual agent activity.
- Explain that the 16 MiB conversation read bound leaves older turns in the
  harness log and is unrelated to relay restarts.

## [0.14.11] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- Add durable per-pane prompt drafts with bounded browser storage and explicit
  fallback when persistence is unavailable.
- Add native, searchable user/assistant conversation history for Claude Code,
  Codex, Qoder, Pi, and Oh My Pi.
- Add literal find across loaded terminal history with match highlighting and
  next/previous navigation through virtualized rows.
- Add **Alt** and multi-modifier terminal chords, ordered key delivery, and
  visible chord confirmation.

### Changed

- Preserve completed-agent triage and recent ordering across relay restarts.

### Fixed

- Keep the mobile terminal navigation pad limited to arrow keys supported by
  Herdr 0.8.0 instead of offering Home, End, Page Up, and Page Down actions
  that fail.
- Keep uncertain prompt deliveries out of the composer and persistent draft
  store so reconnecting cannot invite an accidental duplicate send.

## [0.14.10] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- Add **Rename Session** to the agent menu for every harness except OpenCode. It
  sends `/rename new_session_name`.

### Changed

- Make **Resize Session** the only terminal-width behavior. Remove the
  **Fit to Phone** and **Original Columns** choices from the header and
  Settings.
- Label the existing agent rename action **Rename Tab**. Open either rename
  action in a dedicated form prefilled with the current name; unnamed sessions
  start blank.

### Fixed

- Keep error and status messages above modal backdrops so they remain fully
  visible while a dialog is open.
- Preserve the selected terminal position when **Resize Session** reacts to a
  phone-width change.
- Make **Rename Tab** call Herdr's tab-label operation directly instead of the
  restricted agent-name operation, allowing labels such as `123`.
- Prefill **Rename Session** from the current title on both current and older
  relays without exposing raw session paths or UUIDs.
- Let **Rename Session** submit natural titles with spaces and uppercase
  characters instead of being blocked by tab-name validation.
- Match Activity excerpts to the selected terminal text size and terminal font,
  including Nerd Font status symbols.

## [0.14.9] - 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- Keep the selected terminal history in **Resize Session** instead of showing
  only the roughly 46-row live viewport, and wrap stale desktop-width grids so
  their text remains readable on the phone.

## [0.14.8] - 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- Keep **Resize Session** output live and ordered during long responses by
  replacing only its current viewport while retaining pre-resize scrollback.

## [0.14.7] - 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- Stop checking the app origin every second after its deployment target is
  already loaded, keeping the **About** update status stable.

## [0.14.6] - 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- Keep **Resize Session** text stable across live refreshes by retaining phone
  scrollback and replacing only the clean, current terminal viewport.
- Wait for a hosted app deployment to converge before loading it, so an old
  cached app cannot consume and suppress the automatic update.

## [0.14.5] - 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- Preserve configured terminal scrollback depth in **Resize Session** while
  continuing to discard stale desktop-width rows.

## [0.14.4] - 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- Make **Load Update** replace a stale installed phone app reliably instead of
  retaining its previous document.

## [0.14.3] - 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- Continue pending relay updates automatically after loading a newly deployed
  phone app.

## [0.14.2] - 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- Keep **Resize Session** terminal text stable across refreshes instead of
  mixing stale desktop-width scrollback into the phone-width view.

## [0.14.1] - 2026-08-09

### Fixed

- Let stable setup create the first Cloudflare tunnel when `cloudflared`
  reports `null` for an account with no tunnels.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-08-07

### Changed

- Replace the **Shift+Tab** button with combinable **Shift** and **Ctrl**
  modifier keys: tap either (or both) to arm it, then type a letter or tap
  **Tab** to send the combined chord.
- Keep the terminal's modifier keyboard open across repeated key sends
  instead of closing it after every press; it now closes only when focus
  moves to the composer, terminal, or **Enter**/**Send**.

## [0.13.12] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- Stream agent topology updates from Herdr with a 15-second reconciliation
  backstop.
- Report when older terminal history is left out of a pane view, whether Herdr
  clipped the scrollback or the selected line limit did.

### Fixed

- Classify `server_not_running` command failures as safe-to-retry
  `not_started` results and show the actionable Herdr startup message.
- Keep a multi-step prompt or question answer whose earlier input already
  reached the agent marked as unsafe to retry, so a later `server_not_running`
  failure can no longer invite a duplicate send.
- Preserve unsafe prompt handling for older relays that report
  `dispatched_unknown` without an error payload.
- Keep honouring `HERDR_RELAY_POLL_INTERVAL` while the Herdr event stream is
  unavailable, instead of always falling back to the 15-second reconcile.
- Keep response copying from interrupting an agent's in-flight turn.

## [0.13.11] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed

- Keep the **Check for Updates** controls stable while app and relay checks are in flight.
- Make the cross-browser regression coverage independent of viewport scroll adjustments.

## [0.13.10] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed

- Keep the **Check for Updates** controls stable while app and relay checks are in flight.

## [0.13.9] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed

- Retry rate-limited GitHub release checks through public Atom feeds.
- Reload deployed phone-app bundles with a cache-busted navigation after sleep.
- Reduce the Markdown response preview font size on mobile.

## [0.13.8] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed

- Allow response copying when terminal-only updates keep the pane revision stable.
- Preserve pending agent prompts while running response-copy commands.

## [0.13.7] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed

- Prevent response-copy actions from interrupting active agent turns.
- Handle native copy menus, repeated uncounted confirmations, and empty
  clipboards without accepting stale responses.
- Keep relay response copying independent of slash-command catalog loading and
  correct OMP/Pi session-title resolution.

## [0.13.6] - 2026-08-01

### Fixed

- Copy the latest completed agent response when available, with visible
  terminal output preserved as a fallback.

## [0.13.5] - 2026-08-01

### Fixed

- Preserve app-deployment credentials and settings across detached workers,
  bound their process trees, and keep failures actionable.
- Recover stale relay update state after interrupted workers and terminate
  update subprocess trees without leaving inherited output pipes behind.
- Stop and reap installer `curl`/`wget` downloads on cancellation, including
  metadata downloads, before cleaning temporary files.
- Resolve renamed Qoder, Pi, and Oh My Pi sessions using their stored names.

## [0.13.4] - 2026-07-31

### Fixed

- Route app deployment owners running releases older than 0.13.3 through the
  one-time Terminal bootstrap before scheduling an update. Restored failures
  show the copyable recovery command instead of an update retry loop.


## [0.13.3] - 2026-07-31

### Fixed

- Preserve separately hosted app deployment settings when the managed updater
  hands off to its detached worker, so app-first relay updates no longer fail
  after their release bundle is verified.

## [0.13.2] - 2026-07-31

### Changed

- Replace competing app and per-relay update controls with one source-specific
  safe update action, and distinguish current phone-app status from available
  relay updates. The persistent progress screen publishes the phone app first
  when required, updates relays one at a time, survives reloads, and shows
  terminal errors with an explicit close action.

### Fixed

- Keep Cloudflare Pages deployments in progress while the public app origin
  converges on the verified bundle, instead of reporting a stale edge response
  as a failed deployment that succeeds when retried.

## [0.13.1] - 2026-07-31

### Changed

- From relays running this release onward, deploy and publicly verify a
  separately hosted Cloudflare Pages phone app before installing its
  deployment-owner relay update. Download, compatibility, or deployment
  failures leave the current relay running.

### Security

- Declare phone-app and relay transport capabilities in verified release
  manifests, and refuse upgrades that cannot preserve connectivity in both
  app-first and relay-first rollout windows without a bridge release. This
  release retains E2EE v1 for compatibility with the previous app during the
  upgrade into it.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-07-31

### Added

- Encrypt token-authenticated phone-to-relay WebSockets end to end with a
  key-authenticated ephemeral P-256 handshake, HKDF-SHA-256 session keys, and
  AES-256-GCM frames. Relay keys no longer travel in WebSocket URLs or HTTP
  headers, so Cloudflare Tunnel terminates TLS without receiving relay content.
- Show compact agent logos on the session list for Codex, Claude Code,
  OpenCode, Pi, Oh My Pi, Kimi, and Qoder, with an accessible fallback for
  custom agents.

### Changed

- Reduce the phone app's initial payload by removing unused Tailwind-generated
  CSS and its build integration.

### Security

- Require encrypted client key confirmation before relay registration, so a
  captured client hello cannot be replayed into a live relay connection.
- Reject configured relay keys shorter than 16 bytes and document the
  handshake's offline-guessing boundary.
- Specify the E2EE wire format byte for byte, validate shared deterministic
  Go/browser vectors, and fuzz malformed client hellos and encrypted envelopes.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-07-29

### Changed

- Move active terminal watching to the relay, offer 100 ms, 250 ms, 500 ms, and
  1-second refresh intervals with 250 ms as the default, and send
  fingerprint-acknowledged deltas without repeated full snapshots or terminal
  polling from the phone.
- Negotiate no-context WebSocket compression for messages over 512 bytes,
  reducing full terminal frames and other large relay updates.
- Keep complete terminal-history reads on the persistent Herdr socket instead of
  falling back to a new CLI process for every visible change.

### Fixed

- Keep the live terminal feed refreshing while the prompt input is focused.
- Keep acknowledged completions in the Idle section even while Herdr continues
  reporting an explicit completion status.

## [0.11.2] - 2026-07-28

### Fixed

- Keep the app's displayed upstream version from being downgraded by stale
  release metadata from an older relay.
- Check every connected self-updating relay automatically so installable relay
  updates appear without requiring a manual **Check App** action.

## [0.11.1] - 2026-07-28

### Changed

- Virtualize long terminal histories with measured row heights, bounded DOM
  windows, stable scroll anchors, and a complete copy/accessibility transcript
  so opening the phone keyboard no longer scales with the configured history.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-07-28

### Added

- Three terminal-width modes: **Fit to Phone**, **Original Columns**, and
  **Resize Session**.
- Safe pane-size leases that temporarily resize a live PTY to the measured
  mobile width and restore it on mode exit, disconnect, expiry, or shutdown.
- Bundled Nerd Font symbols for consistent terminal glyphs without a system
  font dependency.
- Default launch profiles for Pi, Oh My Pi, and Kimi.
- Slash-command suggestions for Pi, Oh My Pi, Kimi Code, and OpenCode built-in
  TUI commands.
- A mobile **Ctrl** modifier that opens the phone keyboard and submits the next
  letter as a terminal chord such as `Ctrl+C` or `Ctrl+O`.
- Mobile **Shift+Tab** and **Copy** controls for cycling agent modes and copying
  the visible terminal output.

### Changed

- Move in-app notifications below the header instead of covering terminal
  controls.
- Replaced agent-specific mobile terminal branches with one shared ANSI and
  fixed-grid rendering pipeline.
- Made 1,000 lines the default terminal history, with explicit 100, 5,000, and
  10,000-line choices in Settings.
- Made **Resize Session** the default terminal-width mode when no preference is
  saved.
- Reuse valid in-memory resized frames and rendered HTML when reopening a pane;
  lease renewal and fresh content reconciliation now run in the background.
- Defer offscreen terminal rows and skip repeated ANSI/HTML work for unchanged
  frames to reduce large-history rendering cost.

### Fixed

- Send mobile `Ctrl` letter chords without an unintended Shift modifier.
- Enforce the requested line count after Claude and Qoder history merging, not
  only before it.
- Refresh style-only ANSI rows and read Qoder's current physical screen so
  `/permissions` tab highlights follow arrow-key navigation.
- Submit Qoder prompts and slash commands from **Send** without requiring a
  separate **Enter** action.
- Suppress transient viewport-only snapshots while a resized terminal is still
  reflowing its scrollback.
- Keep long URLs, hashes, and other unbroken strings within responsive terminal
  layouts.
- Preserve box-drawing tables and fixed-grid rows instead of wrapping and
  distorting their cells.
- Release pane-size leases when their WebSocket owner disappears, preventing a
  laptop terminal from remaining narrowed.
